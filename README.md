# Pubspot
Pubspot is an Android application, written in Kotlin, for recording information about your favourite bars and public houses.

## Current features
Our current release, v.1.2.0, includes the following features:

- Add, list, delete, pubs
- Pubs persisted in storage
- Rate pubs with a star-rating
- Tag pubs with relevant points of information
- Set pub location using Google Maps
- Set a pub image (using camera or image gallery)

## Coming soon
We're working on a multi-user version of the app, with users and pubs persisted in storage. Check out the multi-user branch of this repo to see our progress!
